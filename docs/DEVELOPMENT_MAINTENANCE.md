## Creating Releases

This project uses [release-please-action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action) for versioning and releasing OCI packages.

### How should I write my commits?

Release Please assumes you are using [Conventional Commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

The most important prefixes you should have in mind are:

- `fix:` which represents bug fixes, and correlates to a [SemVer](https://semver.org/)
  patch.
- `feat:` which represents a new feature, and correlates to a SemVer minor.
- `feat!:`,  or `fix!:`, `refactor!:`, etc., which represent a breaking change
  (indicated by the `!`) and will result in a SemVer major.

When changes are merged to the `main` branch, the Release Please will evaluate all commits since the previous release to calculate what changes are included and will create another PR to increase the version and tag a new release (per the Release Please design [documentation](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/blob/main/docs/design.md#lifecycle-of-a-release)). This will also automatically generate changelog entries based on these commits.

> TIP: Merging a PR should be done via a branch **"Squash and merge"**; this means that the commit message seen on this PR merge is what Release Please will use to determine a version bump.

When the auto generated Release Please PR is merged the following steps will automatically happen.

1) A new release will be created and tagged
