This package is designed for use as part of a [UDS Software Factory](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-software-factory) bundle deployed on [UDS Core](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core)

## Pre-requisites

Gitlab-Runner has one dependency, Gitlab.

- Utilizing [uds-package-gitlab](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-package-gitlab) is the quickest and easiest solution for meeting this dependency. 

- If choosing not to use `uds-package-gitlab` be aware that the Gitlab-Runner needs to be connected properly to Gitlab for registering itself and running pipelines as expected. 

## Flavors

 Flavor | Description | Example Creation |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------- |
| upstream | Uses upstream images within the package. | `zarf package create . -f upstream` |
| registry1 | Uses images from registry1.dso.mil within the package. | `zarf package create . -f registry1` |

## Releases

The released packages can be found in [ghcr](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-package-gitlab-runner/pkgs/container/packages%2Fuds%2Fgitlab-runner).

## General

- `Upstream` flavor is the default
  - To set a different flavor, use the following flag:
    - `--set FLAVOR=registry1`

- For proper registration of a Gitlab-Runner with a Gitlab instance, a secret is created in the `gitlab-runner` namespace called `gitlab-gitlab-runner-secret` which copies the `runner-registration-token` field from the `gitlab` namespace secret called `gitlab-gitlab-runner-secret`. This is done [here](./tasks/create.yaml#12)

---

## Deploying

Utilizes [UDS-CLI task runners](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-cli)
- Which means `uds run --list` is available for cli descriptions.

#### Using the UDS CLI targets:

```
uds run default
```

#### Available UDS CLI Targets
| UDS CLI Target | Description |
| - | - |
| [default](./tasks.yaml#9) | Setup a k3d cluster, deploy `uds-package-gitlab`, deploy Gitlab Runner |
| [create-package](./tasks.yaml#15) |  Create the Gitlab Runner Package based on the [zarf.yaml](./zarf.yaml) which defaults to `upstream` flavor |
| [gitlab](./tasks.yaml#20) | Setup a k3d cluster and deploy [uds-package-gitlab](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-package-gitlab) |
| [gitlab-runner](./tasks.yaml#27) | Deploy Gitlab Runner only |
| [test-package](./tasks.yaml#37) | Tests the health of a clusters Gitlab and Gitlab Runner |
| [cleanup-gitlab-runner](./tasks.yaml#42) | Remove Gitlab Runner package only from cluster |
| [cleanup-cluster](./tasks.yaml#48) | Remove the k3d cluster and everything in it |

## Tests

Basic tests have been implemented [here](./tasks/test.yaml). 

#### Gitlab Specific Tests
| Test Link | Test Description |
| [Gitlab Gitaly](./tasks/test.yaml#7) | Check the health of Gitlab - Gitaly StatefulSet |
| [Gitlab Postgres](./tasks/test.yaml#13) | Check the health of Gitlab - Postgres StatefulSet |
| [Gitlab Redis](./tasks/test.yaml#19) | Check the health of Gitlab - Redis StatefulSet |
| [Gitlab Webservice](./tasks/test.yaml#25) | Check the health of Gitlab - Webserivce Deployment|
| [Gitlab Secret](./tasks/test.yaml#31) | Check that Gitlab's Runner Secret is created |

#### Gitlab Runner Specific Tests
| Test Link | Test Description |
| [Runner Secret](./tasks/test.yaml#39) | Check that Gitlab Runner's Runner secret is created |
| [Runner Deployment](./tasks/test.yaml#45) | Check the health of the Gitlab Runner's Deployment |
| [Runner Registration](./tasks/test.yaml#51) | Check that Gitlab Runner was able to register with Gitlab |
